# worm-psyqi

WormPsyQi is a semi-automated pipeline for high-throughput analysis of synapses in the nematode C. elegans. Using fluorescent protein-based techniques, WormPsyQi can quantitate multiple features of synapses, including number, size, intensity, and spatial distribution. We provide a pure python-based GUI.

For installation, please see [Installation_guide.pdf](./Installation_guide.pdf)
For running the pipeline, please see [Running_guide.pdf](./Running_guide.pdf)
